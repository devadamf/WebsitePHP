                    The What <em>Really</em> Makes Us Safe? Project is a multimedia project created by Melanie Brazzell
                    in collaboration with many others committed to a vision of safety that includes everyone.
                    Understanding that police, prisons, and border regimes spread insecurity rather than safety, the
                    goal of the project is to explore community-based alternatives to punishment, particularly for
                    addressing gender-based violence. The U.S.-based aspect of the project involved interviews with
                    transformative justice activists in North America as part of academic research. The German-based
                    component brought this knowledge back to the Berlin communities where Melanie was working in the
                    form of a university seminar, public events, workshops, an art exhibition, and a toolkit.

                <p>The project logo is a traditional German sewing box -- a symbol of positive safety as a toolbox of
                    embodied skills and collective resources, in contrast to a negative vision of security based on
                    borders and cages. Artist Andrea Marcos developed a linoleum cut print based on this idea, filling
                    the sewing box with various symbols that represent sources of safety in our lives: lipstick for
                    desire and gender play, a permanent residency visa for the right to safe refuge and migration, a
                    phone to show connection to others (regardless of where they are in the world)... We chose a sewing
                    box, traditionally gendered feminine, rather than a masculine toolbox to show off our queer-feminist
                    angles.
