                        The What <em>Really</em> Makes Us Safe? Project is a multimedia project created by Melanie Brazzell in collaboration with many others committed to a vision of safety that includes everyone. Understanding that police, prisons, and border regimes spread insecurity rather than safety, the goal of the project is to explore community-based alternatives to punishment, particularly for addressing gender-based violence. The U.S.-based aspect of the project involved interviews with transformative justice activists in North America as part of academic research. The German-based component brought this knowledge back to the Berlin communities where Melanie was working in the form of a university seminar, public events, workshops, an art exhibition, and a toolkit.
