                    The What Really Makes Us Safe? Project hosts annual roundtables for people who do research related to transformative justice. We understand research broadly as any activity of focused learning, not limited to academia or journalism or any professional field. Our goal is to build a transnational network of researchers (currently from Australia, Canada, UK, Germany, and the U.S.). Our first roundtable was held in August 2018 and we are planning additional roundtables in San Francisco at the National Women’s Studies Association annual conference in November 2019 and in London in 2020. 
                </p>
                <p class='research-text'>
                    At the roundtable, we share our research (it’s fine if you don’t have any yet!), workshop our shared questions, and develop a framework for how and why to do abolitionist research. To join us, please email whatreallymakesussafe@riseup.net with a description of your current or future research interests, and what you’d like to get out of the roundtable.
